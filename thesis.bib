However, there are also many important problems for which no polynomial-time algorithm is known. Although we cannot prove that none exists we can show that a polynomial-time algorithm for one ``hard'' (more precisely: NP-hard) problem would imply a polynomial-time algorithm for almost all problems discussed in this book (more precisely: all NP-easy problems).},
