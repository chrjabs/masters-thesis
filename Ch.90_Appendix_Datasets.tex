\appendix{Datasets Used for Decision Rule Learning\label{appendix:datasets}}

\Cref{tab:datasets} summarizes the datasets used in the empirical evaluations, including their origin and statistics, as well as the sizes of CNF formulas obtained from them with the encoding from~\textcite{DBLP:conf/cp/MaliotovM18}.
The original files were downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository~\autocite{UciMlr} and from Kaggle ({\small\url{https://www.kaggle.com}}).
Links to the original datasets as well as the files we used will be made available online upon publication.
We randomly and independently sampled subsets of $\nsamp\in\{50,100,1000,5000,10000\}$ data samples from the datasets, four of each size (when applicable), resulting in a         
total of 372 datasets, and discretized the data as in~\autocite{DBLP:conf/cp/MaliotovM18}:
categorical features are one-hot encoded, continuous features discretized by comparing to a collection of thresholds. 

In addition to the name and the source of the datasets, the table shows the number of data samples as well as the number of features before and after discretization.
The last two columns give some statistics about the formulas generated with the encoding from~\textcite{DBLP:conf/cp/MaliotovM18} for two clauses based on the full datasets.
We report both the number of clauses and the number of variables in these formulas.
In case the 16-GB memory limit was already reached, and the run terminated before the formula was created, these two columns are marked with ``memout''.
Note that the memouts are for the full datasets; also for those datasets sampled subsets were used in the experiments.

For the decision rule instances, the instance that took the longest time to solve that did not time out for the \msh{} variant was a subset of 100 examples of the Connect 4 dataset.
The formula of this dataset has 3362 variables and 42621 clauses.
The largest instance in terms of the number of examples that our algorithm was able to find a representative for every pareto point for was a subset of the Travel Insurance dataset with 10000 samples.
When looking at the number of features, the largest solvable dataset was a subset of the Twitter dataset with 50 examples and 1511 discretized features.
