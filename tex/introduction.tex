% What are optimization problems and where do they occur
% Start by telling a story (running example throughout intro)
When somebody is looking for a new flat to buy or rent, most people will be comparing prices with the aim to find the cheapest flat possible that fulfils their requirements.
This is an example of what in mathematics is called an optimization problem.
Optimization problems can be summarized as the task of finding a ``best'' solution out of a collection of possible solutions available.
The notion of ``best'' that is used there is commonly that a ``cost'' associated with each solution shall be minimal.
Speaking in the example from above, the task is to find the flat from all flats that fulfils the requirements with the minimum cost or rent.
If the collection of possible solutions is discrete, we speak of \emph{combinatorial} optimization.

% Applications of optimization in literature
Combinatorial optimization problems do naturally arise in many areas, ranging from industrial applications over research to everyday tasks.
Examples in literature include scheduling of processes in an operating system~\autocite{}, supply chain optimization~\autocite{}, minimizing the loss of a neural network~\autocite{}, air traffic management~\autocite{}, clustering~\autocite{}, learning optimal classifiers~\autocite{} and many more.
Since there is such a variety of applications for combinatorial optimization, there is a plethora of work on solving these optimization problems~\autocite{}.

% Reveal conflicting second objective
Taking a closer look at the flat search example from the beginning, we can notice a problem emerging:
what does ``fulfilling'' the requirements mean?
Some requirements, like the number of rooms, might be easy to specify, but consider the distance of ones daily commute.
Rather than setting a fixed threshold as ``maximum $x$ kilometres distance'', what we might actually want to do is minimize this distance at the same time as the cost of the flat.
Now suddenly there are multiple objectives to take into account regarding what constitutes a ``best'' solution.
This problem is called \emph{multi-objective} optimization.

% Conflicting objectives and why there might be no single optimal solution
The crucial difference between single-objective and the multi-objective optimization is that there is no single notion of optimality for the multi-objective setting.
Whereas for a single objective function, there is a clear minimum (or maximum) and objective values can be clearly compared, this becomes less defined for the multi-objective case:
consider a flat with a cost of 100\,000 \texteuro{} and 4-kilometre daily commute and compare it to another flat that costs 80\,000 \texteuro{} and has a 3-kilometre commute.
In this case it is easy to say that the second option is more optimal.
Now compare the second option to another flat that costs 100\,000 \texteuro{} but only has a 1-kilometre commute.
We cannot easily say which one of these options is better, and the choice would depend on ones personal preference over the two objectives.
This situation commonly occurs when two of the objectives considered are in conflict, as the price of a flat and its commute might be if the commute is towards the city centre and flats in the city centre are more expensive.
