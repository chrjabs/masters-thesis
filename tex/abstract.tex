\begin{abstract}
Many real-world problem settings give rise to \NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.
This results in a need for non-trivial algorithmic solutions for finding optimal solutions to such problems.
Many such solutions---ranging from local search over evolutionary algorithms to declarative programming---have been presented for optimization problems with a single objective.
However, often real-world problems are inherently bi-objective.
For example, when learning interpretable classifiers, one wants to balance the size of the classifier and its classification error.

We present \algname{}, an exact declarative programming approach for finding so-called Pareto-optimal solutions to bi-objective optimization problems.
Using propositional logic as the declarative programming language, we seek to extend the progress and success in maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) solving to two objectives.
The approach can be viewed as an instantiation of the lexicographic method and makes use of a single SAT solver that is preserved throughout the entire search procedure.
\algname{} allows for solving three tasks for bi-objective optimization:
finding a single Pareto-optimal solution, finding one representative solution for each Pareto point, and enumerating all Pareto-optimal solutions.

We provide an open-source implementation of five variants of \algname{}, building on different algorithms proposed for MaxSAT.
We empirically evaluate these five variants, comparing their runtime performance to three competing algorithmic approaches ($P$-minimal, ParetoMCS and Seesaw) and showing practical benefits of our approach in the contexts of learning interpretable decision rules and bi-objective set covering.
Furthermore, for the best-performing variant of \algname{}, we study the effects of proposed refinements to determine their effectiveness.
