\begin{abstract}
Many real-world problem settings give rise to \NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.
This results in a need for efficient algorithmic approaches for finding optimal solutions to such problems.
Because of \NP{} hardness, developing such algorithms is highly non-trivial.
Many approaches---ranging from local-search-style algorithms to declarative programming---have been developed for optimization problems under a single objective.
However, less work has been done on approaches for optimization problems under \emph{multiple} objectives.

We present \algname{}, an exact declarative approach for finding so-called Pareto-optimal solutions to bi-objective optimization problems.
Bi-objective optimization problems arise for example when learning interpretable classifiers, with size, and classification error of classifiers as the two objectives.
Using propositional logic as a declarative programming language, we seek to extend the progress and success in maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) solving to two objectives.
\algname{} can be viewed as an instantiation of the lexicographic method and makes use of a single SAT solver that is preserved throughout the entire search procedure.
Our approach allows for finding a single Pareto-optimal solution, finding one representative solution for each Pareto point, and enumerating all Pareto-optimal solutions.

We provide an open-source implementation of five variants of \algname{}, building on different algorithms proposed for MaxSAT.
We empirically evaluate these five variants, comparing their runtime performance to that of three key competing algorithmic approaches.
The empirical comparison in the contexts of learning interpretable decision rules and bi-objective set covering shows practical benefits of our approach.
Furthermore, for the best-performing variant of \algname{}, we empirically study the effects of proposed refinements to \algname{}.
