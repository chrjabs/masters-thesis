Combinatorial optimization problems arise naturally in many real-world problems.
For this reason, and since these problems are typically \NP-hard, there is a need for non-trivial algorithmic solutions for solving combinatorial optimization.
Many such solutions (e.g., local search, evolutionary algorithms or declarative programming) have been presented for optimization problems with a single objective, however, real-world problems are often inherently bi-objective.

In this work, we present \algname{}, an exact declarative programming approach for finding so-called Pareto-optimal solutions to bi-objective optimization problems.
We use propositional logic as the declarative programming language and seek to extend the progress and success in MaxSAT solving to two objectives.
The presented approach follows the lexicographic method and makes use of a single SAT solver that is preserved throughout the entire search procedure.
\algname{} allows for solving three tasks for bi-objective optimization:
finding a single Pareto-optimal solution, one representative solution for each Pareto point or enumerating all Pareto-optimal solutions.

We provide an open source implementation and evaluate five different variants of \algname{}, all building on different algorithms known from MaxSAT solving.
In the empirical evaluation, we compare \algname{} to three competing algorithmic approaches, showing practical benefits of our approach in the contexts of learning interpretable decision rules and bi-objective set covering.
Furthermore, for the best-performing variant of \algname{}, we study the effects of proposed refinements to determine their effectiveness.
