%% Some notes on bibliography usage and options:
%% natbib -> you can use, e.g., \citep{} or \parencite{} for (Einstein, 1905); with APA \cite -> Einstein, 1905 without ()
%% maxcitenames=2 -> only 2 author names in text citations, if more -> et al. is used
%% maxbibnames=99 as no great need to suppress the biliography list in a thesis
%% for more information see biblatex package documentation, e.g., from https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex 

%% Reference style: select one 
%% for APA = Harvard style = authoryear -> (Einstein, 1905) use:
\usepackage[style=numeric-comp,backend=biber,natbib=true,maxbibnames=99,giveninits=true,uniquename=init,safeinputenc,sorting=none]{biblatex}
%% for numeric = Vancouver style -> [1] use:

%% Write your abstract in the separate file, to be positioned here.

%% STEP 4: Write the thesis.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Your actual text starts here. You shouldn't mess with the code above the line except
%% to change the parameters. Removing the abstract and ToC commands will mess up stuff.
%%
%% Command \include{file} includes the file of name file.tex.
%% A new page will be created at every \include command, 
%% which makes it appropriate to use it for large entities such as book chapters. Cannot be nested.
%% It is useful for a big project, as changing one of the include targets 
%% won't force the regeneration of the outputs of all the rest.
%% Alternatively, \input is a more lower level macro 
%% which simply inputs the content of the given file like it was copy&pasted there manually.
